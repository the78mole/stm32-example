# STM32 example project

This is just an example to test if the correct compiler has been installed on your system.

It does not do any useful tasks except toggle some lights on the STM32F3-Discovery Board.

Nevertheless, it serves well as a make and compiler check.

If you are new to STM32 development and want to setup your toolchain (platform independently), just have a look here:

Have fun with your embedded toolchain ;-)
